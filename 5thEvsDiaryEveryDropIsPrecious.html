                    <h3>1. What were some of the specific strategies that I used to encourage participation? How effective were they? What will I do differently next time?</h3>
                    <p>Strategies included group discussions, gallery walks, hands-on activities (sink and float), and using real-life case studies. These were effective in engaging students and connecting lessons to their experiences. Next time, I might incorporate more role-playing or local field visits to deepen real-world connections.</p>

                <div class="question">
                    <h3>2. Were there any concepts or activities that students found particularly difficult? How will I adapt my approach to address these difficulties in the next lesson?</h3>
                    <p>Students may have struggled with differentiating between droughts and floods and understanding multipurpose dams. To address this, I will use more visual aids like comparative charts and simplified animations, and provide more guided practice with real-life examples.</p>

                    <h3>3. What additional resources or modifications could improve the effectiveness of this lesson in future implementations?</h3>
                    <p>Including more localized videos on river pollution and drought/flood management, interactive digital maps, and inviting a local environmental expert could enhance understanding. Modifying group sizes for more individualized attention during activities may also help.</p>

                    <h3>4. How well did I adjust my teaching based on student reactions or unforeseen challenges?</h3>
                    <p>I adapted by using flexible grouping, providing extra time for complex topics, and incorporating multimedia resources like videos and images when students showed confusion. Moving forward, I will build in more formative checks to adjust pacing in real-time.</p>
