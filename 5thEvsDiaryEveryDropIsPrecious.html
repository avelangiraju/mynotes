                <h3>Worksheet 5: Fisherman and Water Transport</h3>
                <p><strong>1. How can you say that the river is the source of livelihood for fishermen?</strong></p>
                <p>A: Many people make their livelihood by catching fish in the river Krishna. They go on boats across the river and catch a variety of fishes, crabs or lobsters, using nets. They sell them in local markets.</p>

                <h3>Worksheet 6: Sorrow of the Rivers, Droughts and Floods</h3>
                <p><strong>1. What are the causes of water pollution?</strong></p>
                <p>A: Water pollution occurs because effluents from industries, dairy farms, agricultural wastes, and wastes of the thermal power stations drain into the river. The chemical wastes from the industries and power stations cause large scale damage. Water contamination also occurred during the 2009 floods.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Why do rivers get flooded?</strong></p>
                <p>A: Heavy rains are the main cause for floods. Floods occur when there is a heavy rainfall in the catchment area of the river. Another cause of floods is encroaching the catchment area of the rivers and canals with constructions. It is also possible that the rise of water level in the dams and reservoirs causes the gates to be raised, releasing water.</p>

                <h3>Textbook Improve Your Learning Questions (I & II)</h3>
                <p><strong>1. What are the uses of rivers?</strong></p>
                <p>A: Rivers are major water resources. River water is used for a variety of purposes such as drinking, irrigation, and power generation (when stored in dams/reservoirs). They provide livelihood for fishermen. They also function as tourist spots offering recreational facilities like boating and swimming.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Write a brief note on water pollution.</strong></p>
                <p>A: The river Krishna is getting polluted because various wastes drain into it, including effluents from industries, dairy farms, agricultural wastes, and wastes from thermal power stations. This pollution makes the water unsuitable for drinking, whereas long ago people used to drink it directly. The chemical wastes cause large scale damage to the living organisms (aquatic life) in the river.</p>

                <p><strong>4. What are the reasons for drying up of rivers?</strong></p>
                <p>A: The sources do not explicitly state the reasons for rivers drying up, but they indicate that low rainfall or scarce rainfall leads to drought, which means the river flow would be reduced significantly or cease entirely.</p>

                <strong>Why do rivers get flooded?</strong>
                <p>Heavy rains are the main cause for floods. Floods occur when there is a heavy rainfall in the catchment area of the river. Floods are also caused by encroaching the catchment area of the rivers and canals with constructions. If the water level in dams and reservoirs rises, the gates are raised, causing water to flow into nearby areas.</p>

            <li>
                <strong>What are the uses of rivers?</strong>
                <p>Rivers are a source of water supply for purposes such as drinking, irrigation, and power generation. Dams constructed on rivers provide benefits including flood control, water supply, hydro electrical power, waste management, river navigation, and animal habitat. Rivers also provide livelihood for fishermen and serve as tourist spots offering recreational facilities like boating and swimming.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>What are the tributaries of river Krishna?</strong>
                <p>The tributaries of the Krishna river are Bhima, Gayatri, Ghataprabha, Koyna, Malaprabha, Munneru, Nira, Palem, Panchaganga, Tungabhadra, Vemana, and Wyra.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Write a brief note on water pollution.</strong>
                <p>Rivers are getting polluted due to human activities. Effluents from industries, wastes from dairy farms, agricultural wastes, and wastes from thermal power stations drain into the river. This pollution makes the water unsuitable for drinking, and the chemical wastes from industries and power stations cause large scale damage to the living organisms in the river.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>What are the reasons for drying up of rivers?</strong>
                <p>The primary reason is drought, which occurs when there is very little or no rain. When the rainfall is delayed or scarce, it leads to drought.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Collect samples of water from different water resources and discuss which water is suitable for drinking.</strong>
                <p class="note">This is a discussion and field observation task. The sources note that river water, once drunk directly, is now polluted and not useful for drinking purpose due to chemical wastes and contamination.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Collect information from people on how droughts or floods have affected their life.</strong>
                <p>Effects of floods include: huge damage to lives and property; lost huts and cattle; being shifted to flood rehabilitation centres; and suffering from water borne diseases because of water contamination. Effects of droughts include: most agriculture lands becoming non-cultivable; leading people to migrate to different places for livelihood.</p>
            </li>

                    <h3>1. What were some of the specific strategies that I used to encourage participation? How effective were they? What will I do differently next time?</h3>
                    <p>Strategies included group discussions, gallery walks, hands-on activities (sink and float), and using real-life case studies. These were effective in engaging students and connecting lessons to their experiences. Next time, I might incorporate more role-playing or local field visits to deepen real-world connections.</p>

                    <h3>2. Were there any concepts or activities that students found particularly difficult? How will I adapt my approach to address these difficulties in the next lesson?</h3>
                    <p>Students may have struggled with differentiating between droughts and floods and understanding multipurpose dams. To address this, I will use more visual aids like comparative charts and simplified animations, and provide more guided practice with real-life examples.</p>

                    <h3>3. What additional resources or modifications could improve the effectiveness of this lesson in future implementations?</h3>
                    <p>Including more localized videos on river pollution and drought/flood management, interactive digital maps, and inviting a local environmental expert could enhance understanding. Modifying group sizes for more individualized attention during activities may also help.</p>

                    <h3>4. How well did I adjust my teaching based on student reactions or unforeseen challenges?</h3>
                    <p>I adapted by using flexible grouping, providing extra time for complex topics, and incorporating multimedia resources like videos and images when students showed confusion. Moving forward, I will build in more formative checks to adjust pacing in real-time.</p>
